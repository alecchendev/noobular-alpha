Create a comprehensive course about [TOPIC].
This course should include all prerequisites needed to understand this topic.
See example below for existing structure.
Lessons and knowledge points should be atomic and scaffolded such that students are not exposed to too much information at once.
Make sure there are 2-4 knowledge points per lesson.
Make sure there are at least 8 questions per knowledge point.
Knowledge points should try to lean towards active problem solving and application of knowledge instead of just regurgitating information.
Questions should be relevant to the content in a knowledge point.
Answers should not be obvious and should not include hints.
There should be a realistic structure formed through the prerequisites field between knowledge points.
Create the the entire course yaml straight away without further questions.
