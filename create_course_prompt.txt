Create a comprehensive course about <topic>.
Check with me on an outline first.
This course should include all prerequisites needed to understand this topic.
See yaml files in courses directory for existing structure.
Make sure there are at least <number> questions per knowledge point.
Knowledge points should try to lean towards active problem solving instead of just regurgitating information.
Lessons and knowledge points should be atomic and scaffolded such that we are not introducing too much information at once.
Correct vs. incorrect choices should be in a random order, and should not include hints.
Expand or condense material in any way you see fit to better facilitate learning.

Note to self: make sure thinking mode is on. In the future provide the math academy way pdf if possible.
