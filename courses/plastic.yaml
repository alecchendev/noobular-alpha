        description: "Understanding atoms as the building blocks of matter"
        prerequisites: []
        contents:

          - "Atoms consist of a nucleus (containing protons and neutrons) and electrons orbiting around it"
          - "The number of protons determines what element an atom is"
          - "Atoms can bond together to form molecules"
        questions:
          - prompt: "If an atom has 6 protons, 6 neutrons, and 6 electrons, what happens to its identity as an element if it loses 2 neutrons?"

              - text: "It can no longer form bonds"
            explanation: "The element identity is determined solely by the number of protons. Losing neutrons creates a different isotope of the same element, but doesn't change which element it is."
          - prompt: "Two atoms each have 8 protons but one has 8 neutrons and the other has 10 neutrons. How are these atoms related?"

          - prompt: "What is one major challenge in plastic recycling?"
            choices:
              - text: "Plastic is too easy to recycle"
              - text: "Different types of plastics must be separated because they are incompatible when melted together"
                correct: true
              - text: "All plastics are identical"
              - text: "Recycling creates new plastic"
            explanation: "Different plastics (LDPE, HDPE, polypropylene, etc.) have different melting points and properties. Mixing them creates poor-quality material, so separation is essential but challenging."
          - prompt: "How does reducing plastic use compare to recycling in terms of environmental impact?"
            choices:
              - text: "They have identical impacts"
              - text: "Reducing use is more effective because it avoids resource extraction, energy use, and waste generation entirely"
                correct: true
              - text: "Recycling is always better"
              - text: "Neither has any environmental benefit"
            explanation: "Reducing use prevents all upstream impacts (extraction, processing, manufacturing) and downstream impacts (waste). Recycling is beneficial but still requires energy and has limits."
          - prompt: "Why is single-use plastic particularly problematic environmentally?"
            choices:
              - text: "It is not problematic"
              - text: "The material persists for centuries but the product is used only briefly, creating a large waste-to-benefit ratio"
                correct: true
              - text: "It degrades too quickly"
              - text: "It is always recycled"
            explanation: "Single-use plastics like bags or straws are used for minutes but persist for hundreds of years, representing a highly unfavorable ratio of environmental cost to functional benefit."
