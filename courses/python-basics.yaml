        description: "Understanding Python variables and how to work with them"
        prerequisites: []
        contents:
          - "In Python, variables are used to store data. You don't need to declare the type of a variable explicitly."
          - "Common data types include integers (int), floating-point numbers (float), strings (str), and booleans (bool)."
          - "Example: x = 42 creates an integer variable, while name = 'Alice' creates a string variable."
        questions:
          - prompt: "Which of the following is NOT a basic data type in Python?"
            choices:
              - text: "int"
              - text: "float"
              - text: "char"
                correct: true
              - text: "str"
          - prompt: "What will be the type of variable x after: x = 3.14?"
            choices:
              - text: "int"
              - text: "float"
                correct: true
              - text: "str"
              - text: "bool"

    knowledge_points:
      - name: "python-control-flow"
        description: "Understanding control flow statements in Python"
        prerequisites: ["python-variables"]
        contents:
          - "Control flow statements allow you to control the execution order of your program."
          - "The if statement executes code conditionally: if condition: # code block"

      - name: "python-loops"
        description: "Understanding different types of loops in Python and their use cases"
        prerequisites: ["python-control-flow"]
        contents:
          - "For loops iterate over sequences: for item in items: # process item"
          - "While loops repeat until a condition becomes false: while condition: # code block"
        questions:
          - prompt: "Which loop is used to iterate over a sequence in Python?"
            choices:
              - text: "while loop"
              - text: "for loop"
                correct: true

          - prompt: "What will this code print: for i in range(3): print(i)"
            choices:
              - text: "1 2 3"
              - text: "0 1 2"
                correct: true
              - text: "0 1 2 3"
