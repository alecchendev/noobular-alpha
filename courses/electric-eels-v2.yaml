    description: Understanding atomic structure and electric charge
    prerequisites: []
    contents:
    - Atoms are made of protons (positive charge), neutrons (no charge), and electrons
      (negative charge).
    - Protons and neutrons sit in the nucleus (center), while electrons orbit around
      it.
    - A normal atom has equal numbers of protons and electrons, making it electrically
      neutral (no net charge).
    - Like charges repel each other (+ repels +, - repels -). Opposite charges attract
      (+ attracts -).

    description: Understanding how atoms gain or lose electrons
    prerequisites:
    - atoms-and-charge
    contents:
    - Atoms can gain or lose electrons through chemical reactions, physical processes
      (like friction), or interactions with other atoms.
    - Atoms 'want' to have a stable outer electron shell. Some atoms achieve stability
      by losing electrons, others by gaining them.
    - When an atom loses an electron, that electron must go somewhere - to another
      atom or become free.
    - Energy is usually required to remove electrons (breaking the attraction to the
      nucleus). When atoms gain electrons, energy is often released.

    - prompt: An atom rubs against another material and loses electrons. What happens
        to those electrons?

    contents:
    - An ion is an atom (or molecule) that has gained or lost electrons, giving it
      a net electric charge.
    - If an atom loses electrons, it has more protons than electrons, becoming positively
      charged. This is called a cation.
    - If an atom gains electrons, it has more electrons than protons, becoming negatively
      charged. This is called an anion.
    - 'The charge of an ion equals: (number of protons) - (number of electrons). This
      gives you the net charge.'

- title: Concentration and Diffusion
  knowledge_points:
  - name: concentration-basics
    description: Understanding how we measure dissolved substances
    prerequisites:
    - biological-ions
    contents:
    - Concentration measures how much of a substance is dissolved in a liquid - like
      how much sugar is in water.
    - Higher concentration means more particles per volume. Lower concentration means
      fewer particles per volume.
    - Concentration is measured in moles per liter. A mole is 6.02 × 10²³ particles
      (a very large, specific number).
    - In biology, we use millimoles per liter (mM) because the amounts are small.
      1 mM = 0.001 moles per liter = 1/1000 of a mole per liter.
    questions:
    - prompt: Which concentration has more dissolved particles?
      choices:

  - name: diffusion-mechanism
    description: Understanding how and why particles spread out
    prerequisites:
    - concentration-basics
    contents:
    - Particles in a liquid or gas are constantly moving randomly in all directions
      due to their thermal energy.
    - Diffusion is the net movement of particles from high concentration to low concentration,
      driven by this random motion.
    - In a high concentration area, more particles randomly move outward than inward
      (simply because there are more there). In low concentration areas, fewer move
      outward.
    - Diffusion continues until concentration equalizes everywhere. It requires no
      energy input - it's passive.
    questions:
    - prompt: What causes particles to diffuse?
      choices:
      - text: They are pushed by pumps
      - text: Random thermal motion, more particles in high concentration areas move

  - name: concentration-gradients
    description: Understanding concentration differences across space
    prerequisites:
    - diffusion-mechanism
    contents:
    - A concentration gradient exists when concentration is different in different
      locations.
    - The gradient 'points' from high toward low concentration - the direction particles
      will naturally diffuse.
    - Steep gradient = big difference in concentration = fast diffusion. Shallow gradient
      = small difference = slow diffusion.
    - Without a barrier, diffusion eliminates gradients over time. Barriers (like
      membranes) can maintain gradients by preventing free diffusion.

    contents:
    - Electric current is the flow of electric charge from one place to another.
    - In wires, electrons carry the current. In biological systems and water, ions
      (Na+, K+, Cl-) carry current.
    - When positive ions move in a direction, they create current in that same direction.
      When negative ions move, they create current in the opposite direction.

  - name: resistance-and-conductance
    description: Understanding what opposes or allows current flow
    prerequisites:
    - electric-current
    contents:
    - Resistance opposes the flow of electric current. High resistance = hard for
      current to flow.
    - Conductance is the opposite of resistance - it measures how easily current flows.
      High conductance = low resistance.
    - Resistance is measured in ohms (Ω). Conductance is measured in siemens (S) or
      millisiemens (mS).
    - Good conductors (metals, salty water) have low resistance. Insulators (rubber,
      oil, lipids) have high resistance.

    description: Understanding the building blocks of membranes
    prerequisites:
    - biological-ions
    contents:
    - Cell membranes are made of phospholipid molecules. Each phospholipid has a head
      and two tails.
    - The head is hydrophilic ('water-loving') - it's attracted to water because it
      has charged regions.
    - The two tails are hydrophobic ('water-fearing') - they repel water because they're
      made of fatty, uncharged hydrocarbon chains.
    - This dual nature (one part likes water, one part doesn't) causes special behavior
      in water.
    questions:

    description: Understanding how phospholipids arrange in water
    prerequisites:
    - phospholipid-molecules
    contents:
    - In water, phospholipids spontaneously arrange into a bilayer (two layers) to
      protect hydrophobic tails from water.
    - 'The structure: hydrophilic heads face outward (toward water inside and outside
      the cell), hydrophobic tails face inward (away from water).'
    - 'This creates a sandwich: water-loving heads, then water-fearing tails in the
      middle, then water-loving heads.'
    - This arrangement is stable and forms the basic structure of all cell membranes.

    description: Understanding why membranes block charged particles
    prerequisites:
    - lipid-bilayer
    contents:
    - The hydrophobic middle of the membrane repels water and charged particles (ions).
    - Ions are surrounded by water molecules (they're hydrated). To cross the membrane,
      they'd have to enter the hydrophobic region.
    - The hydrophobic core strongly repels these hydrated ions, making the membrane
      an excellent electrical insulator.
    - This barrier property allows cells to maintain different ion concentrations
      on each side.
    questions:
    - prompt: Why can't Na+ easily cross through the lipid bilayer?
      choices:
      - text: Na+ is too large

- title: Ion Channels and Pumps
  knowledge_points:
  - name: ion-channels
    description: Understanding protein pores that allow ions through
    prerequisites:
    - membrane-barrier-property
    contents:
    - Ion channels are proteins embedded in the membrane that form water-filled pores
      through the membrane.
    - When open, channels provide a hydrophilic path, allowing specific ions to flow
      through by diffusion (down their gradient).
    - 'Channels are selective: Na+ channels let Na+ through but not K+. K+ channels
      let K+ through but not Na+.'
    - Selectivity comes from pore size and chemical properties - only ions of the
      right size and charge can pass.
    questions:
    - prompt: What is an ion channel?
      choices:
      - text: A protein pore through the membrane

    description: Understanding movement against gradients
    prerequisites:
    - ion-channels
    - typical-ion-gradients
    contents:
    - Active transport moves ions against their concentration gradient (from low to
      high concentration).
    - This requires energy because you're moving particles in the direction they don't
      naturally want to go.
    - The energy comes from ATP (adenosine triphosphate), the cell's primary energy
      currency.
    - Active transport is needed to create and maintain concentration gradients that
      diffusion would otherwise eliminate.
    questions:
    - prompt: 'Moving Na+ from 12 mM (inside) to 145 mM (outside) is moving:'

    description: Understanding the pump that maintains gradients
    prerequisites:
    - active-transport
    contents:
    - The Na+/K+ pump (sodium-potassium pump) is a protein that actively transports
      Na+ and K+ in opposite directions.
    - 'Each cycle: it pumps 3 Na+ out (from low to high) and 2 K+ in (from low to
      high), using 1 ATP.'
    - 'This maintains the gradients: Na+ stays high outside (145 mM vs 12 mM) and
      K+ stays high inside (140 mM vs 4 mM).'
    - Without this pump running constantly, ion gradients would dissipate and cells
      couldn't generate electrical signals.
    questions:
    - prompt: How many Na+ does the pump move per cycle, and in which direction?
      choices:

    description: Understanding which ions can cross at rest
    prerequisites:
    - sodium-potassium-pump
    - ion-channels
    contents:
    - At rest, some K+ channels are open, but most Na+ channels are closed.
    - This means the membrane is much more permeable to K+ than to Na+ at rest.
    - '''Permeable'' means ions can cross. High permeability = many channels open.
      Low permeability = few channels open.'
    - This differential permeability is crucial for establishing resting potential.

    prerequisites:
    - resting-permeability

    contents:
    - K+ is high inside (140 mM) and low outside (4 mM). With K+ channels open, K+
      flows out down its concentration gradient.
    - K+ is a positive ion. When K+ exits, it removes positive charge from inside
      the cell.
    - Left behind are large negative proteins and other anions that cannot cross the
      membrane.
    - 'This creates charge separation: inside becomes negative, outside becomes positive.'
    questions:

    description: Understanding the electrical force on K+
    prerequisites:
    - potassium-exit
    contents:
    - As K+ leaves, the inside becomes negative. This negative charge attracts positive
      ions like K+.
    - 'Now K+ experiences two forces: (1) concentration gradient pushing OUT, (2)
      electrical gradient pulling IN.'
    - At first, concentration dominates and K+ exits. But as inside gets more negative,
      electrical force gets stronger.
    - Eventually, the two forces balance at equilibrium. K+ wants to leave (concentration)
      but is pulled back (electrical).

    contents:
    - The resting membrane potential is typically around -70 mV (inside negative relative
      to outside at 0 mV).
    - If only K+ could cross, the potential would be about -90 mV (the K+ equilibrium
      potential).
    - But some Na+ leaks in slowly at rest, bringing positive charge in, making it
      less negative than -90 mV.
    - 'The actual -70 mV is a compromise: K+ trying to make it -90 mV, Na+ trying
      to make it positive.'

    description: Understanding what the pump does for resting potential
    prerequisites:
    - resting-potential-value
    contents:
    - The Na+/K+ pump doesn't directly create the -70 mV. The voltage comes from K+
      movement through channels.
    - 'The pump''s role: maintain the concentration gradients (Na+ high outside, K+
      high inside) that drive the ion movements.'
    - Without the pump, gradients would run down and resting potential would disappear.
    - The pump also has a small direct electrical effect (3 out vs 2 in = net removal
      of positive charge), contributing about -10 mV.

    description: Understanding the trigger point for action potentials
    prerequisites:

    contents:
    - Threshold is typically around -55 mV. It's the voltage where enough Na+ channels
      open to trigger an action potential.

      Above threshold: full action potential occurs.'
    - 'Action potentials are ''all-or-nothing'': they either happen completely or
      not at all. There''s no partial action potential.'
    - This is because Na+ channel opening causes more depolarization, which opens
      more Na+ channels - a positive feedback loop.

    - 'The inside rapidly depolarizes: -55 mV → -40 mV → -20 mV → 0 mV → +20 mV →
      +30 mV.'
    - The peak reaches about +30 mV because Na+ influx eventually approaches Na+ equilibrium

    - After an action potential, there's a brief refractory period when another action
      potential cannot occur or is difficult to trigger.
    - 'Absolute refractory period: Na+ channels are inactivated and cannot open, no
      matter how strong the stimulus. No action potential possible.'
    - 'Relative refractory period: Na+ channels recovering, but many still unavailable.
      Stronger-than-normal stimulus needed.'
    - This prevents action potentials from going backward and limits firing frequency.
    questions:

    description: Understanding how action potentials travel
    prerequisites:
    - refractory-period
    contents:
    - An action potential at one location depolarizes the adjacent membrane region
      through local current flow.
    - When adjacent region reaches threshold, its voltage-gated Na+ channels open,
      creating an action potential there.
    - This repeats, creating a wave traveling down the cell. The signal regenerates
      at each point.
    - It only travels forward (not backward) because the refractory period prevents
      re-activation of recently fired regions.

      depolarization.
    - 'The anterior face undergoes an action potential: -85 mV → 0 mV → +65 mV (approximately).'
    - The posterior face receives no signal and lacks voltage-gated Na+ channels,
      so it remains at -85 mV.

      (or vice versa depending on orientation).'
    - Current flows from one end of the eel, through the water (and any prey in the
      water), back to the other end.
    - Water contains dissolved salts (ions like Na+, Cl-) making it conductive. These
      ions carry the current through water.

    - For maximum voltage, all electrocytes must fire simultaneously (within milliseconds).
    - If electrocytes fire at different times, their contributions don't add properly.
      Some may be depolarizing while others are repolarizing.
    - 'Analogy: pushing a swing. Synchronized pushes build amplitude. Random-timed
      pushes interfere and reduce motion.'
    - Synchronization is achieved by nerve signals reaching all electrocytes at nearly
      the same time.

    contents:
    - The eel's brain sends a command signal down specialized nerve fibers (electromotor
      neurons) running along the electric organs.
    - These nerve fibers branch extensively, with each electrocyte receiving its own
      nerve connection.
    - The branching pattern ensures signals reach all electrocytes at nearly the same
      instant (within ~1 millisecond).
    - 'The eel has voluntary control: it decides when to discharge and can vary intensity
      (strong for hunting, weak for navigation).'

      gradients are slightly depleted.
    - 'The Na+/K+ pump works to restore gradients: pumping Na+ back out and K+ back
      in, using ATP.'
    - Recovery takes time (milliseconds to seconds depending on how much gradient
      was depleted).
    - Eels can fire multiple times in quick succession, but repeated firing drains
      ATP and requires rest to fully recover.

    contents:
    - Electric organs contain many columns of electrocytes arranged in parallel (side
      by side), not just one series column.
    - Series connection adds voltage. Parallel connection adds current capacity.
    - Each column contributes the same ~600 V, but multiple columns allow more total
      current to flow.
