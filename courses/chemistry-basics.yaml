    description: Understanding the basic structure of atoms
    prerequisites: []
    contents:
    - 'Atoms are the fundamental building blocks of matter. They consist of three
      subatomic particles: protons, neutrons, and electrons.'
    - Protons are positively charged and found in the nucleus. Neutrons have no charge
      and are also in the nucleus. Electrons are negatively charged and orbit the
      nucleus.
    - The number of protons in an atom determines what element it is. This is called
      the atomic number.

    description: Understanding how matter changes between states
    prerequisites:
    - matter-states
    contents:
    - Phase changes occur when matter transitions from one state to another by adding
      or removing energy (usually heat).
    - Melting is solid to liquid. Freezing is liquid to solid. Evaporation is liquid
      to gas. Condensation is gas to liquid.
    - Sublimation is solid directly to gas (like dry ice). Deposition is gas directly
      to solid (like frost forming).

      choices:
      - text: Solid to liquid
      - text: Liquid to gas
      - text: Gas to liquid

      choices:
      - text: Adding or removing color
      - text: Adding or removing energy
        correct: true

    description: Understanding particle movement and energy in matter
    prerequisites:
    - matter-states
    - phase-changes
    contents:
    - The kinetic molecular theory states that all particles of matter are in constant
      motion. The speed of movement depends on temperature.
    - Higher temperature means particles move faster and have more kinetic energy.
      Lower temperature means slower movement and less energy.

      choices:
      - text: Staying still
      - text: Moving
        correct: true

      - text: Color
      - text: Temperature
        correct: true

      choices:
      - text: They don't move
      - text: They vibrate in place
      - text: Random and rapid motion
        correct: true
      - text: In organized patterns
      explanation: In gases, particles are far apart and move freely at high speeds,
        filling any container completely.
    - prompt: What happens to kinetic energy when temperature decreases?
      choices:
      - text: It increases
      - text: It decreases
        correct: true
      - text: It stays the same
      - text: It doubles
      explanation: Lower temperature means less kinetic energy - particles slow down
        and move less vigorously.

    description: Learning to balance chemical equations
    prerequisites:
    - reaction-types
    contents:
    - Chemical equations represent reactions using chemical formulas. The reactants
      are on the left, products are on the right, separated by an arrow.
    - The law of conservation of mass states that matter cannot be created or destroyed
      in a chemical reaction. Atoms must be balanced on both sides.
    - To balance an equation, adjust the coefficients (numbers in front of formulas)
      so each element has the same number of atoms on both sides.

      - text: Mass cannot be created or destroyed
        correct: true
      - text: Mass always increases
      - text: Mass can disappear

      explanation: Coefficients (numbers before formulas) show how many molecules
        participate - used to balance equations.
    - prompt: Why must chemical equations be balanced?
      choices:
      - text: To look neat
      - text: Because atoms cannot be created or destroyed
        correct: true
      - text: To make calculations harder
      - text: It's optional

    description: Understanding the pH scale and what it measures
    prerequisites: []
    contents:
    - The pH scale measures how acidic or basic a solution is. It ranges from 0 to
      14.
    - A pH of 7 is neutral (like pure water). pH below 7 is acidic. pH above 7 is
      basic (also called alkaline).
    - Each number on the pH scale represents a tenfold difference in acidity or basicity.
      For example, pH 4 is ten times more acidic than pH 5.

  - name: neutralization
    description: Understanding neutralization reactions between acids and bases
    prerequisites:
    - acid-base-properties

    - 'The general equation is: Acid + Base → Salt + Water. For example, HCl + NaOH
      → NaCl + H2O.'
    - During neutralization, hydrogen ions from the acid combine with hydroxide ions
      from the base to form water. This reaction often releases heat.
