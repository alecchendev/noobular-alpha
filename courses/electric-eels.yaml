    description: Understanding atomic structure, electrons, and how atoms become ions
    prerequisites: []
    contents:
    - Atoms are made of protons (positive charge), neutrons (no charge), and electrons
      (negative charge). Protons and neutrons sit in the nucleus, while electrons
      orbit around it.
    - An atom normally has equal numbers of protons and electrons, making it electrically
      neutral. When an atom loses or gains electrons, it becomes an ion.
    - If an atom loses electrons, it has more protons than electrons, so it becomes
      positively charged (a cation). If it gains electrons, it becomes negatively
      charged (an anion).
    - The number of electrons lost or gained determines the ion's charge. Losing 1
      electron = +1 charge, losing 2 = +2 charge, gaining 1 = -1 charge, etc.
    questions:
    - prompt: A sodium atom has 11 protons and 11 electrons. It loses 1 electron.
        What is its charge?
      explanation: With 11 protons (+) and now only 10 electrons (-), there's one
        more positive charge than negative, resulting in a +1 charge.
      choices:
      - text: '+1'
        correct: true
      - text: '-1'
      - text: '0'
      - text: '+11'
    - prompt: A chlorine atom gains 1 electron. It now has 17 protons and 18 electrons.
        What is its charge?
      choices:
      - text: '-1'
        correct: true
      - text: '+1'
      - text: '0'
      - text: '-17'
      explanation: With 17 protons and 18 electrons, there's one more negative charge
        than positive, giving it a -1 charge.
    - prompt: An ion has 12 protons and 10 electrons. What is its charge?
      choices:
      - text: '+2'
        correct: true
      - text: '-2'
      - text: '+10'
      - text: '0'
      explanation: 12 protons (+) minus 10 electrons (-) = +2 charge. More positive
        charges than negative.
    - prompt: Which particle in an atom carries a negative charge?
      choices:
      - text: Electron
        correct: true
      - text: Proton

      - text: Nucleus
      explanation: Electrons are the negatively charged particles that orbit the nucleus.
    - prompt: A calcium atom loses 2 electrons. It had 20 protons and 20 electrons.
        How many electrons does it have now?
      choices:
      - text: '18'
        correct: true
      - text: '22'
      - text: '20'
      - text: '2'
      explanation: 'Starting with 20 electrons and losing 2 leaves 18 electrons. 20
        protons - 18 electrons = +2 charge is shown by the number of electrons: 18.'
    - prompt: An atom has 8 protons and 10 electrons. Is this a cation or anion?
      choices:
      - text: Anion (negatively charged)
        correct: true
      - text: Cation (positively charged)
      - text: Neutral atom
      - text: Cannot determine
      explanation: More electrons (10) than protons (8) means excess negative charge,
        making it an anion.
    - prompt: If a neutral atom has 19 protons, how many electrons must it have?
      choices:
      - text: '19'
        correct: true
      - text: '18'
      - text: '20'
      - text: '0'
      explanation: A neutral atom has equal protons and electrons, so 19 protons means
        19 electrons.

  - name: ion-concentration
    description: Understanding ion concentrations and gradients across membranes
    prerequisites:
    - common-biological-ions
    contents:
    - Concentration measures how much of a substance is dissolved in a solution, usually
      in millimoles per liter (mM).
    - A concentration gradient exists when the concentration of an ion is different
      on two sides of a barrier (like a cell membrane).
    - Ions naturally want to move from high concentration to low concentration (down
      their gradient) by diffusion.
    - 'In cells, Na+ is usually high outside (~145 mM) and low inside (~12 mM). K+
      is the opposite: high inside (~140 mM) and low outside (~4 mM).'
    questions:
    - prompt: If Na+ concentration is 145 mM outside and 12 mM inside, which direction
        does the concentration gradient point?

      explanation: Concentration gradient points from high (145 mM outside) to low
        (12 mM inside), so inward.
    - prompt: K+ concentration is 140 mM inside and 4 mM outside. If a channel opens,
        which way will K+ naturally flow?
      choices:
      - text: Out of the cell
        correct: true
      - text: Into the cell
      - text: No movement
      - text: Depends on temperature
      explanation: Ions naturally flow down their concentration gradient, from high
        (140 mM inside) to low (4 mM outside), so outward.
    - prompt: Which side of the cell membrane has higher Na+ concentration?
      choices:
      - text: Outside
        correct: true
      - text: Inside
      - text: Equal on both sides
      - text: Varies by cell type
      explanation: Na+ is typically 145 mM outside vs 12 mM inside, so outside is
        higher.
    - prompt: If Cl- is 120 mM outside and 4 mM inside, there is a gradient pointing
        in which direction?
      choices:

      choices:
      - text: Energy (moving against gradient)
        correct: true
      - text: No energy (moving down gradient)
      - text: Equal concentration
      - text: A negative charge
      explanation: Moving from low to high concentration is against the gradient and
        requires energy (active transport).
    - prompt: Which ion has higher concentration inside the cell?
      choices:
      - text: K+
        correct: true
      - text: Na+

    description: Understanding charge, charge movement, and electric current
    prerequisites:
    - atoms-and-ions
    contents:
    - Electric charge is a fundamental property carried by particles. Protons have
      positive charge, electrons have negative charge.
    - Like charges repel (+ repels +, - repels -). Opposite charges attract (+ attracts
      -).
    - Electric current is the flow of charged particles. When positive charges move
      in one direction, or negative charges move in the opposite direction, current
      flows.
    - Current is measured in amperes (A). 1 ampere = 1 coulomb of charge passing per
      second. Biological currents are usually microamperes (μA) or smaller.
    questions:
    - prompt: Two positive charges are brought near each other. What happens?
      choices:
      - text: They repel each other
        correct: true
      - text: They attract each other
      - text: Nothing happens
      - text: They become neutral
      explanation: Like charges repel - both positive means they push away from each
        other.
    - prompt: A positive charge and a negative charge are near each other. What happens?
      choices:
      - text: They attract each other
        correct: true
      - text: They repel each other
      - text: Nothing happens

      choices:
      - text: Left to right (same as Na+ movement)
        correct: true
      - text: Right to left (opposite to Na+ movement)
      - text: No current flows
      - text: Current flows in both directions
      explanation: Positive charges moving left to right creates current in the same
        direction (left to right).
    - prompt: Electrons flow from left to right. Which way does current flow?
      choices:
      - text: Right to left (opposite to electron movement)
        correct: true
      - text: Left to right (same as electron movement)
      - text: No current flows
      - text: Perpendicular to electron flow
      explanation: By convention, current flows opposite to electron movement. Electrons
        left-to-right means current right-to-left.
    - prompt: What causes electric current?
      choices:
      - text: Movement of charged particles
        correct: true
      - text: Stationary charges

        correct: true
      - text: 1 ampere
      - text: 0.5 amperes
      - text: 4 amperes
      explanation: Current (amperes) = charge (coulombs) / time (seconds) = 2/1 =
        2 amperes.
    - prompt: Both K+ flowing out and Na+ flowing in contribute to current. Why?
      choices:
      - text: Both involve movement of charged particles
        correct: true
      - text: They cancel each other out
      - text: Only Na+ creates current
      - text: Only K+ creates current
      explanation: Any movement of charged particles (whether K+ or Na+) creates electrical
        current.
  - name: voltage-and-potential
    description: Understanding voltage as electrical potential difference
    prerequisites:
    - electric-charge-and-current
    contents:
    - Voltage (electric potential difference) is the force that pushes charges to
      move. It's measured in volts (V) or millivolts (mV).
    - Voltage exists between two points. If point A is at +50 mV and point B is at
      -50 mV, the voltage difference is 100 mV.
    - Positive charges naturally move from high voltage to low voltage. Negative charges
      move from low voltage to high voltage.
    - Higher voltage difference = stronger push on charges. No voltage difference
      = no push, no current (if resistance is constant).
    questions:
    - prompt: Point A is at +30 mV, point B is at -70 mV. What is the voltage difference?
      choices:
      - text: 100 mV
        correct: true
      - text: 40 mV

      - text: 70 mV
      explanation: Voltage difference = +30 - (-70) = +30 + 70 = 100 mV.
    - prompt: If there's a voltage of 80 mV across a membrane, which way will Na+
        ions be pushed?
      choices:

        correct: true
      - text: From low voltage to high voltage
      - text: No movement
      - text: Perpendicular to voltage
      explanation: Positive ions are pushed from high voltage (positive) to low voltage
        (negative).
    - prompt: 'The inside of a cell is at -70 mV, outside is at 0 mV. Voltage difference
        is:'
      choices:
      - text: 70 mV (outside is higher)
        correct: true
      - text: -70 mV
      - text: 0 mV
      - text: 140 mV
      explanation: Voltage difference = 0 - (-70) = 70 mV, with outside being higher
        voltage.
    - prompt: Two points are both at +40 mV. What is the voltage between them?
      choices:
      - text: 0 mV (no difference)
        correct: true
      - text: 40 mV
      - text: 80 mV
      - text: -40 mV
      explanation: 'If both points are at the same voltage, there''s no voltage difference:
        40 - 40 = 0 mV.'
    - prompt: Negative ions (Cl-) will naturally move toward which voltage?
      choices:
      - text: Higher voltage (positive region)
        correct: true
      - text: Lower voltage (negative region)
      - text: They don't respond to voltage
      - text: Perpendicular to voltage
      explanation: Negative charges are attracted to positive regions (higher voltage).
    - prompt: What happens if you increase voltage difference across a membrane?
      choices:
      - text: Stronger push on ions, more current (if channels open)
        correct: true
      - text: Weaker push on ions
      - text: No effect on ion movement
      - text: Ions stop moving
      explanation: Larger voltage = stronger electrical force pushing ions, resulting
        in more current if channels are open.
    - prompt: 'A battery is 1.5 V. Inside a cell membrane is typically:'
      choices:
      - text: About -70 mV (much less than a battery)

  - name: resistance-and-conductance
    description: Understanding what allows or prevents current flow
    prerequisites:
    - voltage-and-potential
    contents:
    - Resistance opposes current flow. High resistance = hard for current to flow.
      Low resistance = easy for current to flow. Measured in ohms (Ω).
    - Conductance is the opposite of resistance - it measures how easily current flows.
      High conductance = low resistance.
    - 'Ohm''s Law: Current = Voltage / Resistance (I = V/R). For the same voltage,
      higher resistance means less current.'
    - In cells, ion channels control resistance. Closed channels = high resistance
      (no current). Open channels = low resistance (current flows).
    questions:
    - prompt: A membrane has 100 mV voltage and 10 MΩ resistance. Using Ohm's law
        (I = V/R), what happens if resistance doubles to 20 MΩ?

        correct: true
      - text: Current doubles
      - text: Current stays the same
      - text: Current quadruples
      explanation: By Ohm's law (I = V/R), if R doubles, I is halved. Current is inversely
        proportional to resistance.
    - prompt: If voltage is 50 mV and resistance is 5 MΩ, what is the current?
      choices:
      - text: 10 units (50/5)

    - prompt: Same voltage is applied to two membranes. Membrane A has lower resistance
        than B. Which has more current?
      choices:
      - text: Membrane A (lower resistance = more current)
        correct: true
      - text: Membrane B
      - text: Same current
      - text: Neither has current
      explanation: 'Ohm''s law: lower resistance = more current for the same voltage.'
    - prompt: What allows current to flow through a cell membrane?
      choices:
      - text: Open ion channels (low resistance pathway)
        correct: true
      - text: Closed ion channels
      - text: Lipid bilayer (high resistance)
      - text: ATP molecules
      explanation: Ion channels provide low-resistance pathways through the otherwise
        impermeable lipid bilayer.
    - prompt: Voltage increases from 50 mV to 100 mV, resistance stays constant. What
        happens to current?
      choices:
      - text: Current doubles
        correct: true
      - text: Current is halved
      - text: Current stays the same
      - text: Current becomes zero
      explanation: By Ohm's law, current is proportional to voltage. Double the voltage
        = double the current.
    - prompt: A perfect conductor has what resistance?
      choices:
      - text: Zero (no resistance)
        correct: true
      - text: Infinite

    description: Understanding the lipid bilayer and its properties
    prerequisites:
    - common-biological-ions
    contents:
    - The cell membrane is made of a lipid bilayer - two layers of fat molecules (phospholipids)
      with their tails facing inward.
    - The lipid bilayer is hydrophobic (water-fearing) in the middle. This means water
      and ions cannot easily pass through it.
    - The membrane acts as a barrier, separating inside from outside and maintaining
      different ion concentrations on each side.
    - For ions to cross the membrane, they need special proteins - channels or transporters
      - embedded in the bilayer.
    questions:

      - text: They cannot cross at all
      explanation: Ions need protein channels or transporters to cross, as they can't
        pass through the hydrophobic lipid bilayer directly.
    - prompt: The membrane is described as selectively permeable. What does this mean?
      choices:
      - text: Some things can cross (via proteins), others cannot
        correct: true
      - text: Everything can cross freely
      - text: Nothing can cross
      - text: Only water can cross
      explanation: Selectively permeable means the membrane allows some substances
        (via specific channels) to pass while blocking others.
    - prompt: What would happen if the membrane suddenly became fully permeable to
        all ions?
      choices:
      - text: Ion gradients would disappear (ions equalize)
        correct: true
      - text: Ion gradients would increase
      - text: Nothing would change
      - text: Cell would become positively charged
      explanation: Without the barrier, ions would diffuse down their gradients until
        concentrations equalize on both sides.

    description: Understanding channels and pumps in the membrane
    prerequisites:
    - cell-membrane-structure
    contents:
    - Ion channels are proteins that form pores through the membrane. When open, specific
      ions can flow through down their gradient.
    - Channels are selective - Na+ channels allow Na+ but not K+. K+ channels allow
      K+ but not Na+.
    - Pumps (transporters) actively move ions against their gradient using energy
      (ATP). They can create and maintain concentration differences.
    - 'The Na+/K+ pump is crucial: it pumps 3 Na+ out and 2 K+ in, using 1 ATP. This
      maintains the gradients needed for electrical signals.'
    questions:
    - prompt: A Na+ channel opens. Na+ is 145 mM outside, 12 mM inside. What happens?
      choices:
      - text: Na+ flows into the cell (down its gradient)
        correct: true
      - text: Na+ flows out of the cell
      - text: No movement
      - text: K+ flows in
      explanation: Na+ flows down its concentration gradient from high (outside, 145
        mM) to low (inside, 12 mM).
    - prompt: What is the main difference between a channel and a pump?
      choices:
      - text: Channels allow passive flow; pumps use energy to move ions against gradients
        correct: true
      - text: Channels use ATP; pumps don't
      - text: Channels move ions against gradients; pumps allow passive flow
      - text: No difference
      explanation: Channels allow passive flow down gradients (no energy). Pumps use
        ATP to move ions against gradients (requires energy).
    - prompt: The Na+/K+ pump moves 3 Na+ out and 2 K+ in. What does it require?
      choices:
      - text: ATP (energy)
        correct: true
      - text: No energy (passive)
      - text: Light
      - text: Heat
      explanation: Pumps require energy (ATP) to move ions against their concentration
        gradients.
    - prompt: Why is the Na+/K+ pump moving ions 'against' their gradients?
      choices:
      - text: Na+ is pumped to where it's already high; K+ pumped to where it's already
          high
        correct: true
      - text: It moves ions down their gradients
      - text: It doesn't create gradients
      - text: Gradients don't matter for pumps
      explanation: It pumps Na+ to where it's already high (outside) and K+ to where
        it's already high (inside), opposing natural diffusion.
    - prompt: A K+ channel opens. K+ is 140 mM inside, 4 mM outside. What happens?
      choices:
      - text: K+ flows out of the cell
        correct: true
      - text: K+ flows into the cell
      - text: Na+ flows in
      - text: No ion movement
      explanation: K+ flows down its concentration gradient from high (inside, 140
        mM) to low (outside, 4 mM).
    - prompt: What makes ion channels selective?
      choices:
      - text: Pore size and chemical properties allow only specific ions through
        correct: true
      - text: All ions can pass through any channel
      - text: Channels have no selectivity
      - text: Only size matters
      explanation: Channel pore size and chemical properties (charge, shape) allow
        only specific ions to pass.
    - prompt: If the Na+/K+ pump stops working, what eventually happens to ion gradients?
      choices:
      - text: Gradients dissipate (Na+ and K+ equalize across membrane)
        correct: true
      - text: Gradients increase
      - text: Nothing changes
      - text: Only Na+ gradient is affected
      explanation: Without the pump maintaining gradients, ions diffuse until concentrations
        equalize across the membrane.

  knowledge_points:
  - name: resting-membrane-potential
    description: Understanding why cells have negative voltage inside
    prerequisites:
    - membrane-proteins
    - voltage-and-potential
    contents:
    - The resting membrane potential is the voltage across the membrane when a cell
      is at rest, typically around -70 mV (inside negative relative to outside).
    - 'This negative voltage exists because: (1) Na+/K+ pump creates gradients, (2)
      K+ channels are open at rest, (3) K+ flows out, leaving negative charge behind.'
    - When K+ (positive) exits through open channels, it leaves behind negative proteins
      and other anions that cannot cross the membrane.
    - 'An equilibrium is reached: K+ wants to leave (concentration gradient) but is
      held back by electrical attraction to the negative interior.'
    questions:
    - prompt: At rest, is the inside of a cell positive or negative relative to outside?
      choices:
      - text: Negative (about -70 mV)
        correct: true
      - text: Positive
      - text: Neutral (0 mV)
      - text: Varies randomly
      explanation: Resting membrane potential is typically -70 mV, meaning inside
        is negative relative to outside.
    - prompt: Which ion's movement primarily creates the resting potential?
      choices:
      - text: K+ leaving through open channels
        correct: true
      - text: Na+ entering
      - text: Cl- entering
      - text: Ca2+ entering
      explanation: K+ leaving through open K+ channels creates the negative resting
        potential.
    - prompt: Why does the inside become negative when K+ leaves?
      choices:
      - text: Positive charge (K+) exits, leaving negative charge behind
        correct: true
      - text: K+ carries negative charge with it
      - text: Negative charge enters from outside
      - text: The membrane creates negative charge
      explanation: When positive K+ ions exit, they leave behind negative charges
        (proteins, anions that can't cross).
    - prompt: At resting potential, why doesn't all K+ leave the cell?
      choices:
      - text: Electrical attraction pulls K+ back (inside is negative)
        correct: true
      - text: K+ channels close completely
      - text: K+ cannot cross the membrane
      - text: There's no concentration gradient
      explanation: The negative interior electrically attracts positive K+ back in,
        balancing the outward concentration gradient.
    - prompt: 'The Na+/K+ pump''s role in resting potential is to:'
      choices:
      - text: Maintain Na+ and K+ gradients that drive ion flow
        correct: true
      - text: Directly create the -70 mV
      - text: Block K+ channels
      - text: Eliminate all ion movement
      explanation: The pump maintains the Na+ and K+ concentration gradients that
        drive the ion flows creating the resting potential.
    - prompt: If K+ channels close at rest, what happens to membrane potential?
      choices:
      - text: Becomes less negative (closer to 0 mV)
        correct: true
      - text: Becomes more negative
      - text: Stays at -70 mV
      - text: Becomes positive
      explanation: With less K+ leaving, fewer positive charges exit, so the inside
        becomes less negative (moves toward 0).
    - prompt: What two forces act on K+ at resting potential?
      choices:
      - text: Concentration gradient (outward) and electrical gradient (inward)
        correct: true
      - text: Both push inward
      - text: Both push outward
      - text: No forces act on K+
      explanation: Concentration gradient pushes K+ out (high inside to low outside).
        Electrical gradient pulls K+ in (attracted to negative interior).
  - name: depolarization-and-hyperpolarization
    description: Understanding changes in membrane potential
    prerequisites:
    - resting-membrane-potential
    contents:
    - 'Depolarization means the membrane becomes less negative (moves toward 0 mV
      or positive). Example: -70 mV → -50 mV → 0 mV → +30 mV.'
    - 'Hyperpolarization means the membrane becomes more negative (moves away from
      0). Example: -70 mV → -80 mV → -90 mV.'
    - Na+ entering the cell causes depolarization (brings positive charge in, makes
      inside less negative).
    - K+ leaving the cell causes hyperpolarization (removes positive charge, makes
      inside more negative).
    questions:
    - prompt: 'Membrane potential changes from -70 mV to -50 mV. This is called:'
      choices:
      - text: Depolarization (less negative)
        correct: true
      - text: Hyperpolarization
      - text: Repolarization
      - text: No change
      explanation: Moving from -70 to -50 is less negative (closer to 0), which is
        depolarization.
    - prompt: 'Membrane potential changes from -70 mV to -90 mV. This is:'
      choices:
      - text: Hyperpolarization (more negative)
        correct: true
      - text: Depolarization
      - text: Neutral state
      - text: Resting potential
      explanation: Moving from -70 to -90 is more negative (farther from 0), which
        is hyperpolarization.
    - prompt: Na+ channels open and Na+ rushes into the cell. What happens to membrane
        potential?
      choices:
      - text: Depolarizes (becomes less negative/more positive)
        correct: true
      - text: Hyperpolarizes (becomes more negative)
      - text: No change
      - text: Becomes exactly 0 mV
      explanation: Positive Na+ entering makes the inside less negative (or more positive),
        causing depolarization.
    - prompt: K+ channels open more than usual, K+ flows out. What happens?
      choices:
      - text: Hyperpolarization (more negative)
        correct: true
      - text: Depolarization (less negative)
      - text: No effect
      - text: Membrane potential becomes positive
      explanation: Positive K+ leaving makes the inside more negative, causing hyperpolarization.
    - prompt: Which change represents depolarization?
      choices:
      - text: -80 mV to -60 mV
        correct: true
      - text: -60 mV to -80 mV
      - text: -70 mV to -70 mV
      - text: 0 mV to -20 mV
      explanation: -80 to -60 is less negative (moving toward 0), which is depolarization.
    - prompt: To depolarize a cell, which ion should enter?
      choices:
      - text: Na+ (positive ion entering)
        correct: true
      - text: K+ (exiting causes opposite effect)
      - text: Cl- (negative ion)
      - text: No ion needed
      explanation: Positive Na+ ions entering bring positive charge in, making the
        interior less negative (depolarization).
    - prompt: At +30 mV, is the membrane depolarized relative to rest (-70 mV)?
      choices:
      - text: Yes, it's much less negative (depolarized)
        correct: true
      - text: No, it's hyperpolarized
      - text: It's at resting potential
      - text: Cannot determine
      explanation: +30 mV is much less negative than -70 mV (actually positive), so
        yes, it's greatly depolarized.
  - name: action-potential-mechanism
    description: Understanding how action potentials work
    prerequisites:
    - depolarization-and-hyperpolarization
    - resistance-and-conductance
    contents:
    - An action potential is a rapid depolarization and repolarization. It's an all-or-nothing
      electrical signal that travels along nerves and muscle cells.
    - 'Steps: (1) Stimulus opens Na+ channels → Na+ rushes in → depolarization to
      +30 mV. (2) Na+ channels close, K+ channels open → K+ exits → repolarization
      back to -70 mV.'
    - Voltage-gated channels open/close based on membrane potential. Na+ channels
      open when membrane reaches threshold (about -55 mV).
    - 'The action potential propagates: depolarization at one spot triggers Na+ channels
      to open in adjacent regions, creating a wave of depolarization.'
    questions:
    - prompt: What triggers voltage-gated Na+ channels to open?
      choices:
      - text: Membrane potential reaching threshold (about -55 mV)
        correct: true
      - text: ATP
      - text: Temperature increase
      - text: Light
      explanation: These channels open when the membrane voltage reaches a threshold
        value (about -55 mV).
    - prompt: During the rising phase of an action potential (going to +30 mV), which
        ion flows?
      choices:
      - text: Na+ flows in
        correct: true
      - text: K+ flows out
      - text: Cl- flows in
      - text: Ca2+ flows out
      explanation: The rising phase (going toward +30 mV) is caused by Na+ influx
        through opened Na+ channels.
    - prompt: During repolarization (returning to -70 mV), which ion flows?
      choices:
      - text: K+ flows out
        correct: true
      - text: Na+ flows in
      - text: Na+ flows out
      - text: No ions flow
      explanation: Repolarization back to negative voltage is caused by K+ flowing
        out of the cell.
    - prompt: What makes an action potential 'all-or-nothing'?
      choices:
      - text: Either threshold is reached and full action potential occurs, or nothing
          happens
        correct: true
      - text: It can be any size
      - text: Only half the channels open
      - text: It requires all Na+ to enter
      explanation: Either the threshold is reached and a full action potential fires,
        or the threshold isn't reached and nothing happens - no partial action potentials.
    - prompt: How does an action potential travel along a nerve?
      choices:
      - text: Depolarization at one spot opens channels in adjacent regions
        correct: true
      - text: Ions physically travel the length of the nerve
      - text: ATP pushes it along
      - text: It doesn't travel
      explanation: Depolarization at one location opens adjacent voltage-gated Na+
        channels, creating a wave of depolarization that propagates.
    - prompt: At the peak of action potential (+30 mV), what must happen to return
        to rest?
      choices:
      - text: Na+ channels close and K+ channels open
        correct: true
      - text: Na+ channels stay open
      - text: All channels close permanently
      - text: Pump must activate
      explanation: Na+ channels must close (stopping Na+ entry) and K+ channels open
        (allowing K+ exit) to return to resting potential.
    - prompt: Threshold is -55 mV. A stimulus brings membrane to -60 mV. What happens?
      choices:
      - text: No action potential (didn't reach threshold)
        correct: true
      - text: Full action potential
      - text: Partial action potential
      - text: Cell dies
      explanation: At -60 mV, threshold (-55 mV) wasn't reached, so voltage-gated
        Na+ channels don't open and no action potential occurs.

    description: Understanding the modified muscle cells that generate electricity
    prerequisites:
    - eel-body-structure
    contents:
    - Electrocytes are modified muscle cells - they evolved from muscle tissue but
      lost the ability to contract. Instead, they specialize in generating voltage.
    - Each electrocyte is like a disk or coin, with distinct front (anterior) and
      back (posterior) faces.
    - The front face has voltage-gated Na+ channels and can generate an action potential.
      The back face does not - it only has the Na+/K+ pump.
    - 'This asymmetry is crucial: when activated, the front face depolarizes (+65
      mV) while the back stays at rest (-85 mV), creating a voltage difference of
      150 mV across the cell.'
    questions:

    - prompt: Why is asymmetry important in electrocytes?
      choices:
      - text: One side depolarizes, the other doesn't, creating larger voltage difference
        correct: true
      - text: Both sides must be identical
      - text: Asymmetry prevents function
      - text: No asymmetry exists

      explanation: At rest, both faces are at resting potential, approximately -85
        mV.
    - prompt: When stimulated, why does the front face depolarize?
      choices:
      - text: Voltage-gated Na+ channels open, Na+ enters
        correct: true
      - text: K+ channels open
      - text: The pump activates
      - text: ATP is released
      explanation: Nerve stimulation opens voltage-gated Na+ channels on the front
        face, allowing Na+ to rush in and depolarize it.
    - prompt: Why doesn't the back face depolarize when the eel fires?
      choices:
      - text: It has no voltage-gated Na+ channels to open
        correct: true
      - text: It lacks a membrane
      - text: It's made of different material
      - text: The nerve signal reaches it too
      explanation: The back face has no voltage-gated Na+ channels, so it can't generate
        an action potential even when the nerve fires.
    - prompt: 'After activation, front is +65 mV and back is -85 mV. Calculate the
        voltage difference:'

        correct: true
      - text: 20 mV
      - text: 65 mV
      - text: 0 mV
      explanation: Voltage across = front - back = +65 - (-85) = 150 mV.
    - prompt: What triggers the front face to depolarize?
      choices:
      - text: Nerve signal from the eel's nervous system
        correct: true
      - text: Spontaneous activity
      - text: Back face signal
      - text: Water temperature
      explanation: A nerve signal from the eel's nervous system triggers the voltage-gated
        Na+ channels to open.
    - prompt: One electrocyte acts like a battery of what voltage?
      choices:
      - text: 150 mV (0.15 V)
        correct: true
      - text: 1.5 V
      - text: 600 V
      - text: 1 mV
      explanation: Each electrocyte produces 150 mV (0.15 V) when activated.
    - prompt: At rest, is there voltage difference across a single electrocyte?
      choices:
      - text: No (both sides at -85 mV)
        correct: true
      - text: Yes (150 mV difference)
      - text: Yes (300 mV difference)
      - text: Only during sleep
      explanation: 'At rest, both faces are at -85 mV, so no difference: -85 - (-85)
        = 0 mV.'

    description: Understanding how electrocytes add voltages to create high voltage
    prerequisites:
    - single-electrocyte-discharge
    contents:
    - When batteries or voltage sources are connected in series (+ to -), their voltages
      add up. Two 1.5 V batteries in series = 3 V total.
    - Electrocytes are stacked in series inside the electric organ. One electrocyte's
      positive face connects to the next one's negative face.
    - 'Each electrocyte contributes 150 mV. With 1000 electrocytes in series: 1000
      × 150 mV = 150,000 mV = 150 V.'
    - 'Electric eels have about 5,000-6,000 electrocytes in series. This creates:
      5,000 × 150 mV = 750 V (though actual measured voltage is around 600 V due to
      some losses).'
    questions:
    - prompt: Two 150 mV electrocytes are connected in series. What is the total voltage?
      choices:
      - text: 300 mV
        correct: true
      - text: 150 mV
      - text: 75 mV
      - text: 0 mV
      explanation: 'In series connection, voltages add: 150 + 150 = 300 mV.'
    - prompt: 'If 1000 electrocytes (each 150 mV) are in series, total voltage is:'
      choices:
      - text: 150 V (150,000 mV)
        correct: true
      - text: 150 mV
      - text: 1.5 V
      - text: 1500 V
      explanation: 'Multiply: 1000 × 150 mV = 150,000 mV = 150 V.'
    - prompt: How do electrocytes connect to add voltage?
      choices:
      - text: In series (+ of one to - of next)
        correct: true
      - text: In parallel (all + together, all - together)
      - text: Randomly
      - text: They don't connect
      explanation: Series connection (+ terminal of one to - terminal of next) causes
        voltages to add.
    - prompt: 'An eel has 6,000 electrocytes at 150 mV each. Theoretical maximum voltage:'
      choices:
      - text: 900 V (6000 × 0.15 V)
        correct: true
      - text: 600 V
      - text: 150 V
      - text: 6 V
      explanation: 6,000 × 150 mV = 6,000 × 0.15 V = 900 V theoretical maximum.
    - prompt: Why is actual eel voltage (600 V) less than theoretical maximum (900
        V)?
      choices:
      - text: Some voltage is lost to resistance/inefficiency
        correct: true
      - text: Not all electrocytes fire
      - text: Eels can't count to 6000
      - text: Water absorbs voltage
      explanation: Resistance in tissues and inefficiencies in the biological system
        cause some voltage loss.
    - prompt: What happens if you double the number of electrocytes in series?
      choices:
      - text: Voltage doubles
        correct: true
      - text: Voltage stays the same
      - text: Voltage halves
      - text: Current doubles
      explanation: In series, voltages add, so doubling the number doubles the total
        voltage.
    - prompt: 'Connecting voltage sources in parallel (instead of series) would:'
      choices:
      - text: Keep voltage the same, not add them
        correct: true
      - text: Add voltages like series
      - text: Multiply voltages
      - text: Create infinite voltage
      explanation: Parallel connection maintains the same voltage but can increase
        current capacity - voltages don't add.
  - name: synchronized-discharge
    description: Understanding how the eel controls the discharge
    prerequisites:
    - voltage-summation-in-series
    contents:
    - For maximum voltage, all electrocytes must fire simultaneously. If they fire
      at different times, voltages don't add properly.
    - The eel's brain sends a signal down a specialized nerve (like a command center).
      This nerve branches to reach all electrocytes at nearly the same time.
    - The nerve signal causes all front faces to receive the trigger simultaneously,
      opening all Na+ channels at once.
    - This synchronized firing creates the full 600+ volt discharge. The eel can control
      when to fire (hunting, defense) and can fire multiple times in succession.
    questions:
    - prompt: Why must all electrocytes fire at the same time?
      choices:
      - text: For voltages to add properly to maximum effect
        correct: true
      - text: They don't need to fire together
      - text: Only one electrocyte fires at a time
      - text: Timing doesn't matter
      explanation: For all 150 mV contributions to add up simultaneously to create
        the maximum voltage output.
    - prompt: What triggers all electrocytes to discharge simultaneously?
      choices:
      - text: Nerve signal from the brain reaching all cells at once
        correct: true
      - text: Random spontaneous activity
      - text: Temperature change
      - text: Light signal
      explanation: A coordinated nerve signal from the brain reaches all electrocytes
        at once via branching nerves.
    - prompt: If half the electrocytes fire and half don't, what happens to voltage?
      choices:
      - text: Voltage is roughly halved (only firing cells contribute)
        correct: true
      - text: Voltage doubles
      - text: Voltage stays at 600 V
      - text: No voltage is produced
      explanation: Only the firing electrocytes contribute voltage, so roughly half
        fire = roughly half the total voltage.
    - prompt: 'The eel can control its discharge for:'
      choices:
      - text: Hunting, defense, and navigation
        correct: true
      - text: Only hunting
      - text: Only defense
      - text: It cannot control the discharge
      explanation: 'The eel voluntarily controls when to discharge for different purposes:
        hunting prey, defending against predators, and navigating.'
    - prompt: How does the brain signal reach all electrocytes simultaneously?
      choices:
      - text: Specialized nerve branches to all cells at once
        correct: true
      - text: Each cell has its own brain
      - text: Signals travel through water
      - text: Chemical diffusion
      explanation: The nerve from the brain branches extensively to reach all electrocytes
        simultaneously.
    - prompt: Can an electric eel fire multiple shocks in a row?
      choices:
      - text: Yes, it can discharge multiple times
        correct: true
      - text: No, only once per day
      - text: No, only once in lifetime
      - text: Only twice total
      explanation: Yes, eels can produce multiple discharges in quick succession.
    - prompt: What would happen if nerve signals arrived at different times to different
        electrocytes?
      choices:
      - text: Reduced total voltage (mistimed firing)
        correct: true
      - text: Increased voltage
      - text: No effect
      - text: Permanent damage
      explanation: Non-simultaneous firing means not all electrocytes contribute at
        once, reducing the peak voltage output.
