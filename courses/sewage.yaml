        description: "Understanding how gravity is the primary engine of a sewer system."
        prerequisites: []
        contents:
          - "Gravity is the force that pulls objects, including water, 'downhill'."
          - "To make water flow from one point to another without pumps, the destination point must be at a lower elevation than the starting point."
          - "Sewer pipes are installed at a precise, slight downward angle (a 'slope' or 'grade') to ensure water and waste flow continuously towards the treatment plant."
        questions:
          - prompt: "A 100-meter-long sewer pipe is installed perfectly flat (0% slope). What will happen to the wastewater inside it?"
            choices:
              - text: "It will flow very quickly."
              - text: "It will flow backwards."
              - text: "It will remain stationary, and solids will settle, causing a blockage."
                correct: true
            explanation: "Without a downward slope, gravity cannot pull the water along the pipe. The water will stagnate, and the solids will settle, leading to a clog."
          - prompt: "To *increase* the flow speed in a new gravity-powered pipe, what must an engineer do?"
            choices:
              - text: "Increase the pipe's diameter."
              - text: "Increase the pipe's downward slope."
                correct: true
              - text: "Make the pipe's interior rougher."
            explanation: "A steeper slope means gravity has a stronger component pulling the water along the pipe's length, increasing its velocity."
          - prompt: "A builder needs to connect a house's sewer line to the city main, which is 50 meters away. The house's exit pipe is at an elevation of 100.5m. The city main connection is at 100.3m. Will this design work?"
            choices:
              - text: "Yes, because the destination is at a lower elevation."
                correct: true
              - text: "No, because the pipe is too long."
              - text: "No, because the elevation difference is too small."
            explanation: "The only requirement for basic gravity flow is that the outlet (100.3m) is lower than the inlet (100.5m), which it is."
          - prompt: "Why can't a single, continuous gravity sewer pipe go from a valley, up over a hill, and into the next valley?"
            choices:
              - text: "The pipe would be too long."
              - text: "The water pressure would be too high."
              - text: "Gravity only pulls water downhill and cannot push it up the hill."
                correct: true
            explanation: "Gravity provides the force for downhill flow. It cannot provide the force to push water *up* a slope against its pull."
          - prompt: "A pipe has a slope of 1:100 (1%). How far does it drop vertically over a horizontal distance of 200 meters?"
            choices:
              - text: "1 meter"
              - text: "2 meters"
                correct: true
              - text: "10 meters"
            explanation: "A 1% slope means the pipe drops 1 meter for every 100 meters of horizontal distance. Over 200 meters, it will drop (200 / 100) * 1m = 2m."
          - prompt: "Two gravity pipes (A and B) are the same diameter. Pipe A has a 3% slope. Pipe B has a 1% slope. Which statement is true?"
            choices:
              - text: "Pipe B will carry more water per minute than Pipe A."
              - text: "Pipe A will carry more water per minute than Pipe B."
                correct: true
              - text: "Both pipes will carry the same amount of water."
            explanation: "The steeper slope of Pipe A (3%) will cause the water to flow at a higher velocity, allowing it to transport a greater volume of water per unit of time."
          - prompt: "What is the *primary* force that moves wastewater through most of a city-wide collection system?"
            choices:
              - text: "Pumping pressure from lift stations."
              - text: "Gravity."
                correct: true
              - text: "Air pressure from the vent systems."
            explanation: "While lift stations are used when necessary, the vast majority of a sewer network is designed to use the free and reliable force of gravity."
          - prompt: "A section of sewer pipe is accidentally installed with a 'belly' or a dip in the middle. What is the most likely outcome?"
            choices:
              - text: "The flow will speed up to get past the dip."
              - text: "Solids will settle in the dip, and a blockage will form."
                correct: true
              - text: "The dip will act as an extra P-trap, which is beneficial."
            explanation: "The 'belly' creates a section with no downward slope, allowing water to stagnate and solids to settle, just as they would in a flat pipe."

        description: "Classifying the different types of materials found in wastewater."
        prerequisites: []
        contents:
          - "Wastewater is a complex mixture, not just 'dirty water'."
          - "It contains **settleable solids**: heavy, inorganic materials like sand, grit, and eggshells that sink quickly."
          - "It contains **suspended solids**: lighter, organic materials like feces, food scraps, and paper that float or stay mixed in the water, making it cloudy."
          - "It contains **dissolved solids**: substances like sugar, salt, urine, and chemicals that are fully dissolved in the water and cannot be seen."
        questions:
          - prompt: "Sand and gravel from roads get washed into a sewer. How are these materials best classified?"
            choices:
              - text: "Dissolved solids"
              - text: "Suspended solids"
              - text: "Settleable solids"
                correct: true
            explanation: "Sand and gravel are heavy, inorganic materials that sink quickly. They are 'settleable'."
          - prompt: "If you let a jar of raw sewage sit undisturbed for an hour, the material that falls to the bottom is primarily:"
            choices:
              - text: "Settleable solids and some suspended solids."
                correct: true
              - text: "Dissolved solids."
              - text: "Only suspended solids."
            explanation: "Gravity will pull down the heavy settleable solids first, as well as the portion of suspended solids that are dense enough to sink (this process is called sedimentation)."
          - prompt: "Which of the following is an example of a *dissolved* solid in wastewater?"
            choices:
              - text: "Coffee grounds"
              - text: "Sugar from a soft drink"
                correct: true
              - text: "Toilet paper"
            explanation: "Sugar dissolves completely in water, becoming part of the liquid solution. Coffee grounds and paper are suspended solids."
          - prompt: "Why is it important to remove *settleable* solids (like grit) early in the treatment process?"
            choices:
              - text: "Because grit is a valuable resource to sell."
              - text: "Because grit is highly abrasive and will damage pumps and pipes."
                correct: true
              - text: "Because grit is the main source of disease."
            explanation: "Grit (sand, gravel) acts like liquid sandpaper, rapidly wearing down pumps, pipes, and other mechanical equipment."
          - prompt: "Which category of solids is responsible for making wastewater 'cloudy' or 'turbid'?"
            choices:
              - text: "Settleable solids"
              - text: "Suspended solids"
                correct: true
              - text: "Dissolved solids"
            explanation: "Suspended solids are the particles that float or stay mixed in the water column, blocking light and causing the cloudy appearance."
          - prompt: "A restaurant illegally dumps cooking oil into the sewer. This oil would be classified as:"
            choices:
              - text: "A settleable solid (it sinks)."
              - text: "A suspended solid (it floats or mixes)."
                correct: true
              - text: "A dissolved solid (it disappears)."
            explanation: "Fats, oils, and grease (FOG) are lighter than water and will float or remain suspended. They do not sink or dissolve."
          - prompt: "Which type of solid can *only* be removed by biological processes or advanced chemical/physical processes?"
            choices:
              - text: "Settleable solids"
              - text: "Suspended solids"
              - text: "Dissolved solids"
                correct: true
            explanation: "Settleable and suspended solids can be removed by physical settling or screening. Dissolved solids are part of the water and must be 'eaten' by microbes or removed with technologies like reverse osmosis."
          - prompt: "The process of 'sedimentation' (letting water sit) is designed to remove:"
            choices:
              - text: "Settleable solids and some suspended solids."
                correct: true
              - text: "Dissolved solids and suspended solids."
              - text: "Only dissolved solids."
            explanation: "Sedimentation uses gravity to pull down anything heavier than water, which includes all settleable solids and a large portion of the suspended solids."

      - name: "microbe-basics"
        description: "Differentiating between pathogens and decomposers in wastewater."
        prerequisites: []
        contents:
          - "**Pathogens** are 'bad' microorganisms (bacteria, viruses, protozoa) in sewage that come from human waste. They spread diseases like cholera, typhoid, and E. coli infections."
          - "**Decomposers** are 'good' microorganisms (mostly bacteria) that are either naturally present or cultivated. Their 'job' is to eat the organic waste (suspended and dissolved solids) in sewage."
          - "Wastewater treatment is largely a process of killing the 'bad' bugs (pathogens) and helping the 'good' bugs (decomposers) do their job."
        questions:
          - prompt: "What is the *primary* reason untreated sewage is a major public health hazard?"
            choices:
              - text: "It smells bad."
              - text: "It contains disease-causing pathogens."
                correct: true
              - text: "It is too hot."
            explanation: "The smell is a nuisance, but the pathogens are what transmit diseases and cause epidemics."
          - prompt: "The 'secondary treatment' stage of a wastewater plant is a biological process. Its main goal is to:"
            choices:
              - text: "Use 'good' microbes (decomposers) to consume the dissolved organic waste."
                correct: true
              - text: "Use chemicals to kill all microbes, both good and bad."
              - text: "Filter out sand and grit."
            explanation: "This stage is all about cultivating a massive population of decomposers to 'eat' the dissolved waste that Primary Treatment couldn't remove."
          - prompt: "The organism that causes cholera is found in sewage. It is best described as a:"
            choices:
              - text: "Decomposer"
              - text: "Pathogen"
                correct: true
              - text: "Biosolid"
            explanation: "Cholera is a disease, so the organism that causes it is a pathogen."
          - prompt: "What is the main 'food' source for the *decomposer* microbes in a treatment plant?"
            choices:
              - text: "Chlorine and other chemicals."
              - text: "Sand and grit."
              - text: "Dissolved organic matter (BOD)."
                correct: true
            explanation: "Decomposers consume the organic waste (measured as BOD, or Biochemical Oxygen Demand) that we consider 'pollution'."
          - prompt: "Most decomposers used in wastewater treatment are *aerobic*. What does this mean they require to work effectively?"
            choices:
              - text: "Sunlight"
              - text: "Oxygen"
                correct: true
              - text: "High pressure"
            explanation: "Aerobic microbes, like humans, breathe oxygen. This is why aeration tanks have air bubbled through them."
          - prompt: "If all the decomposer bacteria in a treatment plant suddenly died, what would be the result?"
            choices:
              - text: "The water leaving the plant would be cleaner."
              - text: "The water leaving the plant would still be full of dissolved organic waste."
                correct: true
              - text: "The plant would no longer smell."
            explanation: "Without the 'good' bacteria, the dissolved waste (BOD) would pass through the plant untreated, leading to heavy pollution."
          - prompt: "The *disinfection* stage (e.g., using chlorine or UV light) at the *end* of the plant specifically targets:"
            choices:
              - text: "Pathogens"
                correct: true
              - text: "Decomposers"
              - text: "Dissolved solids"
            explanation: "By the end, the decomposers have done their job. The final step is to kill any remaining 'bad' bugs (pathogens) to make the water safe to return to the environment."
          - prompt: "Why can't we just dump sewage in a pond and let the 'good' microbes clean it up?"
            choices:
              - text: "The concentration of waste is too high, overwhelming the natural microbes and using up all the oxygen."
                correct: true
              - text: "The 'good' microbes don't live in ponds."
              - text: "The 'bad' microbes (pathogens) would be killed too quickly."
            explanation: "This process, called eutrophication, leads to oxygen depletion (hypoxia) and 'dead zones' because the waste (BOD) is too high for the natural system to handle."

    knowledge_points:
      - name: "wastewater-types"
        description: "Differentiating between greywater and blackwater."
        prerequisites:
          - "solids-liquids-basics"
        contents:
          - "**Blackwater** is wastewater from toilets. It contains feces and urine, which means it has a very high concentration of pathogens and organic waste (BOD)."
          - "**Greywater** is wastewater from all other household sources: sinks, showers, laundry, and dishwashers. It contains soaps, detergents, food particles, and some pathogens, but is generally less contaminated than blackwater."
          - "In a standard plumbing system, both greywater and blackwater are combined and sent to the sewer as 'wastewater' or 'sewage'."
        questions:
          - prompt: "Water from a washing machine is classified as:"
            choices:
              - text: "Greywater"
                correct: true
              - text: "Blackwater"
              - text: "Stormwater"
            explanation: "Since it does not come from a toilet, it is greywater. Its main contaminants are soaps and dirt."
          - prompt: "Which type of wastewater is *required* to be sent to the sewer system dueto its high pathogen load?"
            choices:
              - text: "Greywater"
              - text: "Blackwater"
                correct: true
              - text: "Rainwater"
            explanation: "Blackwater contains human feces, which is the primary source of dangerous waterborne pathogens. It must be treated."
          - prompt: "A homeowner wants to install a system to recycle water from their shower to flush their toilets. This system would be reusing:"
            choices:
              - text: "Blackwater"
              - text: "Greywater"
                correct: true
              - text: "Potable water"
            explanation: "Water from a shower is greywater. This is a common water-saving strategy, as it uses less-contaminated water for a non-drinking purpose."
          - prompt: "What is the *primary* reason blackwater is considered significantly more hazardous than greywater?"
            choices:
              - text: "It contains high levels of fecal pathogens."
                correct: true
              - text: "It contains soaps and detergents."
              - text: "It is often a different temperature."
            explanation: "The presence of feces and urine in blackwater makes its pathogen content exponentially higher and more dangerous."
          - prompt: "Which of these sources produces *only* blackwater?"
            choices:
              - text: "A toilet"
                correct: true
              - text: "A kitchen sink"
              - text: "A bathtub"
            explanation: "The toilet is the sole source of blackwater in a home."
          - prompt: "What are the main 'pollutants' of concern in greywater from a kitchen sink?"
            choices:
              - text: "Fecal coliforms"
              - text: "Soaps and food scraps (BOD)."
                correct: true
              - text: "High levels of chlorine."
            explanation: "Kitchen sink greywater is high in organic matter from food (BOD) and phosphates/soaps from detergent."
          - prompt: "When blackwater and greywater are combined in a home's plumbing, the resulting mixture is simply called:"
            choices:
              - text: "Greywater"
              - text: "Sewage"
                correct: true
              - text: "Sludge"
            explanation: "Once blackwater is mixed in, the entire stream is classified as sewage and must be fully treated."
          - prompt: "Some environmental designs separate greywater from blackwater. What is the most likely reason for this?"
            choices:
              - text: "To treat the small, hazardous blackwater stream more intensively."
              - text: "To easily reuse the less-contaminated greywater for non-potable uses like irrigation."
                correct: true
              - text: "To sell the greywater to a treatment plant."
            explanation: "By keeping them separate, the large volume of greywater can be relatively easily and cheaply treated on-site for uses like flushing toilets or watering lawns, saving water."

      - name: "drains-vents"
        description: "Understanding how drains and vents work together to move waste."
        prerequisites:
          - "gravity-basics"
        contents:
          - "A building's plumbing system has two main parts: drain pipes and vent pipes."
          - "**Drain pipes** use gravity to carry wastewater away from fixtures (sinks, toilets) and down to the main sewer line."
          - "**Vent pipes** connect to the drain pipes and run up to the building's roof, open to the air. They do *not* carry water."
          - "The purpose of the vent system is to supply air to the drains. This prevents a suction (siphon) from forming, which would suck water out of the traps and allow sewer gas to enter."
        questions:
          - prompt: "What is the *primary* purpose of the vent pipe that extends to a building's roof?"
            choices:
              - text: "To act as an overflow if the drain clogs."
              - text: "To supply air to the drain system to prevent suction."
                correct: true
              - text: "To capture rainwater and help flush the pipes."
            explanation: "Vents allow air to be drawn in *behind* the flowing water, breaking any potential vacuum and allowing traps to remain full."
          - prompt: "A homeowner flushes a toilet and hears a loud 'gurgling' sound from the nearby bathtub drain. This is a classic symptom of:"
            choices:
              - text: "A blocked or improperly installed vent."
                correct: true
              - text: "Water pressure that is too high."
              - text: "A new P-trap."
            explanation: "The gurgling is the sound of air being *sucked* through the bathtub's P-trap. This means the vent isn't supplying air, so the rushing water is pulling air from the next available source."
          - prompt: "If a plumbing system were built with *no* vent pipes, what would be the most likely outcome?"
            choices:
              - text: "Water would flow down the drains much faster."
              - text: "The drains would siphon water out of the P-traps, allowing sewer gas to enter."
                correct: true
              - text: "The drain pipes would be much quieter."
            explanation: "Without a vent, a 'slug' of water flowing down a pipe creates a powerful vacuum behind it, which will easily siphon the water barrier out of any nearby P-traps."
          - prompt: "Where does a plumbing vent pipe system terminate?"
            choices:
              - text: "In the basement, next to the water heater."
              - text: "In the main sewer line under the street."
              - text: "Above the roof, open to the atmosphere."
                correct: true
            explanation: "It must be open to the atmosphere to allow air to enter freely. The roof is the safest and most common location."

                correct: true
              - text: "The weight of the water."
            explanation: "The vent system breaks the siphon, so the water plug in the P-trap is not 'pulled' by the water flowing past it."
          - prompt: "A three-story apartment building has sinks, toilets, and showers on every floor, all connected. How many main 'vent stacks' (vertical vents) are likely required?"

        contents:
          - "Every fixture (sink, toilet, shower) has a 'trap'. The most common is the 'P-trap', the U-shaped pipe under a sink."
          - "A trap's only job is to hold a small amount of water, creating a 'water seal'."
          - "This water seal physically blocks sewer gases (like hydrogen sulfide and methane) from the sewer main from flowing up the drain and into the building."
          - "The vent system protects this water seal from being siphoned away."
        questions:

              - text: "A sewer main."
            explanation: "A toilet has a built-in 'S-trap'. The water in the bowl is the 'water seal' that blocks sewer gases from coming up from the drain."
          - prompt: "A homeowner returns from a 4-month vacation and notices a strong sewer smell in a guest bathroom. After running the sink for 10 seconds, the smell goes away. What happened?"
            choices:

              - text: "A bathtub."
            explanation: "A toilet has its trap built-in. A bathtub's trap is hidden under the floor. A sink's trap is the visible U/P-shaped pipe in the cabinet below it."
          - prompt: "If you hear a gurgling sound from a drain, immediately *followed* by a sewer smell, what has likely just happened?"
            choices:

                correct: true
              - text: "The drain has been cleaned."
            explanation: "The gurgle was the sound of the trap's water being sucked away, and the smell is the *result* of the now-broken seal."
          - prompt: "A P-trap is full of water. A large 'slug' of water flows down the pipe from an upstairs fixture, and there is *no vent*. What force pulls the water out of the P-trap?"

        contents:
          - "The pipe connecting a single house to the street is the **lateral**."
          - "Laterals connect to **sewer mains** (or 'collectors') which run under streets, collecting wastewater from many homes."
          - "Sewer mains must be sloped precisely, typically at ~2% grade (or 1/4 inch per foot), to achieve a 'self-cleaning' velocity of ~2 feet per second (0.6 m/s)."
          - "If the slope is *too shallow*, solids settle and cause clogs. If the slope is *too steep*, the water flows too fast, leaving the heavier solids behind, also causing clogs."
        questions:
          - prompt: "The single pipe running from your house to the city's pipe under the street is called a:"

              - text: "The water will flow too slowly, causing a backup."
              - text: "The steep slope will cause the pipe to burst."
            explanation: "This is a common misconception. A slope that's too steep is as bad as one that's too shallow. The liquid outruns the solids, which get stranded and build up."
          - prompt: "Why is a flow velocity of 2 feet per second (0.6 m/s) considered ideal for a sewer main?"
            choices:
              - text: "It's the maximum speed water can travel in a pipe."
              - text: "It's slow enough to allow solids to settle."
              - text: "It's fast enough to keep solids suspended (self-cleaning)."
                correct: true
            explanation: "This velocity provides enough energy to keep organic solids and grit moving, preventing them from settling in the pipe and causing a blockage."
          - prompt: "A sewer main is designed with a 2% slope. Over a horizontal distance of 100 meters, how far will the pipe drop vertically?"

              - text: "A pipe made from a hollowed-out tree trunk."
            explanation: "Like the trunk of a tree, a trunk sewer is a large, main collector that receives flow from many smaller 'branches' (collector mains)."
          - prompt: "'Infiltration' is when groundwater leaks *into* a sewer pipe through cracks. Why is this a problem?"
            choices:

                correct: true
              - text: "It makes the sewage flow too fast."
            explanation: "Infiltration means the treatment plant is receiving and treating clean groundwater or rainwater, which is unnecessary, costly, and can overload the plant during storms."
          - prompt: "A sewer main has a very *shallow* slope (e.g., 0.1%). What is the likely outcome?"
            choices:

              - text: "The pipe will clean itself very effectively."
            explanation: "A shallow slope doesn't provide enough gravitational force to achieve self-cleaning velocity. The water slows, and solids drop out of suspension."

              - text: "Using them on crops."
            explanation: "Incineration reduces the solids to a small, sterile ash, but it is energy-intensive and can cause air pollution if not controlled."
          - prompt: "A plant produces 100 'wet tons' of liquid digested sludge (at 4% solids) per day. After dewatering, it produces 16 'wet tons' of biosolid cake (at 25% solids). How many tons of *water* were removed per day?"
            choices:
              - text: "84 tons"
                correct: true
              - text: "16 tons"
              - text: "4 tons"
            explanation: "The process started with 100 tons of material and ended with 16 tons. The difference (100 - 16 = 84 tons) is the weight of the water that was removed."

        description: "Understanding the problem with mixing rain and sewage."
        prerequisites:
          - "gravity-mains"
        contents:
          - "**Sanitary Sewer:** A modern design. One set of pipes *only* carries wastewater (sewage) to the WWTP."
          - "**Storm Sewer:** A separate set of pipes that *only* carries rainwater (stormwater) from street grates *directly* to the nearest river or lake, untreated."
          - "**Combined Sewer:** An older design (common in cities built before ~1940). One *single, large pipe* carries *both* sewage and stormwater to the WWTP."
          - "The *problem* with combined sewers: during heavy rain, the flow is 50-100x normal. The WWTP cannot handle it. To prevent the plant from flooding, the system is designed to overflow, dumping **untreated, raw sewage** mixed with rainwater (a **Combined Sewer Overflow, or CSO**) directly into the river."
        questions:
          - prompt: "A *sanitary sewer* system is designed to carry:"
            choices:
              - text: "Only wastewater from homes and businesses."
                correct: true
              - text: "Only rainwater from street grates."
              - text: "Both wastewater and rainwater."
            explanation: "'Sanitary' refers to the (unsanitary) wastewater, as opposed to 'storm' water."
          - prompt: "In a *modern* city with separate systems, where does the water from a storm drain on the street go?"
            choices:
              - text: "To the wastewater treatment plant (WWTP)."
              - text: "Directly to the nearest river or lake, untreated."
                correct: true
              - text: "To the drinking water plant."
            explanation: "Stormwater is (supposedly) just rain. It is not treated, which is why it's illegal to dump oil or soap into a storm drain."
          - prompt: "What is the *single biggest problem* with an old *combined sewer system*?"
            choices:
              - text: "The pipes are too big and expensive."
              - text: "During heavy rain, they overflow and discharge raw sewage into the environment."
                correct: true
              - text: "They cannot handle toilet paper."
            explanation: "This is a Combined Sewer Overflow (CSO), a massive and common source of pollution in older cities."
          - prompt: "A 'Combined Sewer Overflow (CSO)' is a discharge of:"
            choices:
              - text: "Fully treated effluent."
              - text: "A mix of rainwater and untreated, raw sewage."
                correct: true
              - text: "Only rainwater."
            explanation: "A CSO is a 'relief valve' for the combined system, but what it releases is a highly polluted mixture of sewage and stormwater."
          - prompt: "A new, fast-growing suburb is being built today. It will *definitely* install which type of system?"
            choices:
              - text: "A combined sewer system."
              - text: "Separate sanitary and storm sewer systems."
                correct: true
              - text: "No sewer system (all septic tanks)."
            explanation: "Combined sewers have been effectively 'banned' for new construction for decades due to the massive pollution they cause. Separate systems are the modern standard."
          - prompt: "Why is it illegal and harmful to connect your house's roof gutters (downspouts) to the *sanitary* sewer pipe?"
            choices:
              - text: "It's considered 'stealing' rainwater."
              - text: "It sends a huge volume of clean rainwater to the WWTP, wasting money and capacity."
                correct: true
              - text: "It will contaminate the rainwater with sewage."
            explanation: "This is 'inflow'. It's like turning on a firehose of clean water at the WWTP. The utility has to pay to pump and treat that clean water, and it can overload the plant, causing backups."
          - prompt: "An old city is under a legal order to fix its CSO problem. What is a likely, (though expensive) engineering solution?"
            choices:
              - text: "Build massive, deep underground storage tunnels to hold the overflow."
                correct: true
              - text: "Disconnect all the toilets in the city."
              - text: "Pump the CSOs to a different city."
            explanation: "Many cities (like Chicago, London, DC) have built (or are building) enormous 'deep tunnels' to capture the combined overflow during a storm and hold it until the rain stops, then pump it to the WWTP for treatment."
          - prompt: "'Inflow and Infiltration' (I&I) is the name for clean (ground/rain) water getting into *sanitary* sewer pipes. Why is this a major problem?"
            choices:
              - text: "It dilutes the sewage, making it *easier* to treat."
              - text: "It's 'phantom' flow that costs the utility money to pump and treat, wasting plant capacity."
                correct: true
              - text: "It helps clean the pipes."
            explanation: "I&I is a huge financial drain. A utility might be treating 30% more water than it needs to, all because of leaks in the pipes. This also reduces the plant's 'real' capacity during storms."

        prerequisites:
          - "preliminary-treatment"
          - "drains-vents"
        contents:
          - "Sewer systems clog. The main culprits are tree roots (seeking water) and blockages from human activity."
          - "The biggest blockage problem is **FOG** (Fats, Oils, and Grease). When hot grease (like bacon fat) is poured down a drain, it cools, solidifies, and sticks to the pipe walls."
          - "This FOG combines with other items, especially **'flushable' wipes** (which *do not* break down like toilet paper), to form massive, concrete-hard blockages called **fatbergs**."
          - "Rule: The *only* things that should ever be flushed down a toilet are the '3 P's': **Pee, Poo, and (Toilet) Paper**."
        questions:
          - prompt: "What does 'FOG' stand for in the wastewater industry?"
            choices:

              - text: "Fast Overflowing Gutters."
              - text: "Final Organic Grade."
            explanation: "FOG is the industry term for the grease and oil that comes from cooking and kitchens, which is a primary cause of blockages."
          - prompt: "What is the *best* way to dispose of hot cooking grease (e.g., from bacon)?"
            choices:
              - text: "Pour it down the sink, followed by hot water and soap."
              - text: "Pour it into a can, let it cool and solidify, then put it in the solid waste (trash)."
                correct: true
              - text: "Flush it down the toilet."
            explanation: "Hot water only moves the grease a few feet down the pipe, where it will cool and solidify in the *city's* main, causing a public blockage. It must be disposed of as a solid."
          - prompt: "A 'fatberg' is a massive clog in a sewer main composed primarily of:"
            choices:
              - text: "Tree roots and sand."
              - text: "FOG (grease) and 'flushable' wipes."
                correct: true
              - text: "Excessive toilet paper."
            explanation: "The wipes act as a 'scaffolding' for the FOG to cling to, building up over time into huge, hard blockages that must be chiseled out."
          - prompt: "Why are 'flushable' wipes a *massive* problem for sewer systems?"
            choices:
              - text: "They are toxic and kill the 'good' microbes."
              - text: "They do not break down or disintegrate like toilet paper."
                correct: true
              - text: "They dissolve too quickly and clog filters."
            explanation: "Despite the 'flushable' label, these wipes are made of woven fibers (often plastic) that do not tear apart. They clog house laterals, jam pumps, and are the main ingredient in fatbergs."
          - prompt: "Besides FOG and wipes, what is another common cause of *structural* damage and blockages in older sewer pipes?"
            choices:
              - text: "Tree roots."
                correct: true
              - text: "Water flowing too fast."
              - text: "The pipe being too sloped."
            explanation: "Tree roots will naturally seek out the water and nutrients in a sewer pipe, growing into tiny cracks and expanding until they break the pipe and fill it with a mat of roots."
          - prompt: "A restaurant is illegally dumping its deep fryer oil into the sewer every night. This is a major problem because:"
            choices:
              - text: "It will cool and solidify, causing a massive blockage in the public sewer main."
                correct: true
              - text: "It will help the microbes at the WWTP grow."
              - text: "The oil is a fire hazard in the pipes."
            explanation: "This is the #1 cause of sewer overflows from restaurants. The volume of FOG is so large it quickly clogs the main, causing sewage to back up into basements or overflow from manholes."
          - prompt: "Which of the following items is *safe* to flush down a toilet?"
            choices:
              - text: "A cotton swab (Q-tip)."
              - text: "A facial tissue (e.g., Kleenex)."
              - text: "Toilet paper."
                correct: true
            explanation: "Only toilet paper is engineered to disintegrate rapidly in water. Tissues, paper towels, and wipes are designed to stay strong when wet and *will* cause clogs."
          - prompt: "The '3 P's' rule states the *only* things that should be flushed are:"
            choices:
              - text: "Pee, Poo, and Paper (Toilet Paper)."
                correct: true

              - text: "Pesticides, Paint, and Pharmaceuticals."
            explanation: "This simple rule summarizes what the sewer system is designed to handle. Anything else (wipes, medicine, FOG, chemicals) can damage the system or pollute the environment."
